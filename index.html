  <p>The Telegraph is used to communicate across extremely long distances by sending electrical bursts that could be translated to letters. It can communicate over infinitely long distances and takes mere seconds to send messages. Old technology would take much longer to arrive and the farther you send the message, the longer it would take. This isnâ€™t the case for the Telegraph. Everyone who wants to communicate with people from faraway lands will love the Telegraph.</p>
