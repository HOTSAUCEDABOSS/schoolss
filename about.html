    <p>My name is Samuel F.B. Morse. I was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts on April 27, 1791. I went to Yale college in New Haven, Connecticut. I was an American painter, and I eventually became an art teacher at the “University of the City of New York.” I was always interested in the little understood subject of electricity. While studying art in Europe, I overheard a conversation about the newly discovered electromagnet. This is what sparked the idea of an electric telegraph. My partners Alfred Vale and Leonard Gale helped him invent the Telegraph. My invention helped develop communication across long distances in short amounts of time. It created the roots of the old and modern-day telephone.</p>
